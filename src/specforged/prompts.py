## The 5 EARS Requirement Types

### 1. **Ubiquitous** - Always Active
**Format:** THE SYSTEM SHALL [action/behavior]
**Example:** THE SYSTEM SHALL log all user actions for audit purposes

### 2. **Event-Driven** - Triggered by Events
**Format:** WHEN [event] THE SYSTEM SHALL [response]
**Example:** WHEN a user submits invalid data THE SYSTEM SHALL display validation errors

### 3. **State-Driven** - Active During States
**Format:** WHILE [state] THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]
**Example:** WHILE processing a payment THE SYSTEM SHALL show a progress indicator

### 4. **Optional Features** - Conditional Capabilities
**Format:** WHERE [feature] THE SYSTEM SHALL [capability]
**Example:** WHERE authentication is required THE SYSTEM SHALL redirect to login

### 5. **Unwanted Behavior** - Error Responses
**Format:** IF [undesired condition] THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL [response]
**Example:** IF the user is logged in THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL display personalized content

## Complete Scenario Coverage

Have you considered **all scenarios** for each user story?
- **Normal events** (WHEN...) - Expected user actions and system events
- **Continuous states** (WHILE...) - System behavior during ongoing states
- **Optional cases** (WHERE...) - Features that may be enabled/disabled
- **Error conditions** (IF...THEN...) - Handling invalid inputs and failures
- **Universal rules** (THE SYSTEM SHALL...) - Always-active constraints

## Quality Checklist

Each requirement should be:
✓ **Testable** - Can write an automated test case
✓ **Unambiguous** - Only one possible interpretation
✓ **Complete** - All conditions and responses specified
✓ **Consistent** - No contradictions with other requirements
✓ **Feasible** - Technically and practically achievable
✓ **Traceable** - Links to specific user needs/stories

## Interactive Coaching Available

If you provide a vague requirement, I can help refine it into proper EARS format.

**Example refinement:**
- Vague: "Handle login errors"
- Refined: "IF a user enters incorrect credentials THEN THE SYSTEM
  SHALL display a clear error message and offer password reset option"

What requirements would you like to define in EARS format? I can
help refine them for clarity and completeness.""",

solution.

## Design Phase Guidance

### 1. **Architecture & System Style**
What overall architecture style suits this project?
- **Layered Architecture** (MVC, MVP, MVVM) - Clear separation of concerns
- **Microservices** - Independent, scalable services
- **Client-Server** - Traditional web app structure
- **Event-Driven** - Reactive, message-based systems
- **Serverless** - Function-as-a-service architecture

What are the main components or modules, and what are their responsibilities?

### 2. **Technology Choices**
- **Frontend**: Framework preferences (React, Vue, Angular, vanilla JS)?
- **Backend**: Language and framework (Node.js, Python/Django, Java/Spring)?
- **Database**: SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis)?
- **APIs**: REST, GraphQL, or WebSocket requirements?
- **External integrations**: Third-party services, payment processors, etc.?

### 3. **Data Models & Schemas**
What key data entities will you need?
- User models, business objects, configuration data
- Relationships between entities
- Data validation rules and constraints
- Storage requirements and access patterns

### 4. **System Interactions**
How do components communicate?
- API endpoints and request/response patterns
- Data flow between components
- User interaction flows
- Error handling and recovery strategies

### 5. **Sequence Diagrams** (Optional)
Would a diagram help illustrate key interactions?
We can use Mermaid syntax for sequence diagrams:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>+Frontend: Submit form
    Frontend->>+Backend: POST /api/data
    Backend->>+Database: INSERT query
    Database-->>-Backend: Success response
    Backend-->>-Frontend: 201 Created
    Frontend-->>-User: Show success message
```

### 6. **Non-Functional Requirements**
Consider performance, security, and scalability:
- Expected user load and response times
- Security requirements and authentication
- Data privacy and compliance needs
- Scalability and deployment considerations

## Design Review Checkpoint

You can:
- **Answer these areas one by one** - Work through each section
  systematically
- **Ask for examples** - I can suggest patterns for your specific needs
- **Request best practices** - Get recommendations for technology choices
- **Iterate on decisions** - Refine architecture based on requirements

Once you're satisfied with the design, I'll compile it into a
comprehensive `design.md` document and we can proceed to
implementation planning.

                    text="""Great! Now let's break down your specification into
actionable implementation tasks.

## Step 1: Generate Your Implementation Plan

Shall I generate an initial implementation plan based on your requirements
and design?

I'll analyze your:
- **User stories** and EARS requirements for functional tasks
- **Design components** and architecture for technical tasks
- **Dependencies** between tasks to create proper order
- **Requirements traceability** so each task links back to
  specific needs

The result will be a **hierarchical task breakdown** with numbered
tasks (1, 1.1, 1.2, 2, etc.) in GitHub-style checkbox format.

## Step 2: Review and Refine (After Generation)

Once generated, you can:
- **Review the task list** - Check if it makes sense and covers
  everything
- **Ask for modifications** - "Add a task for user testing" or
  "Break down task 2 further"
- **Discuss approaches** - "How should I approach task 3.1?" for implementation advice

## Step 3: Manage Tasks Naturally

You can manage your tasks conversationally:
- **"Mark task 2.1 as done"** → ✅ I'll check it off
- **"Complete tasks 1.1 and 1.2"** → ✅ I'll handle multiple at once
- **"Show me what's next"** → I'll list available tasks
- **"How's my progress?"** → I'll show completion stats

Or use direct commands if you prefer:
- `check_task(spec_id, "2.1")` - Mark specific task complete
- `get_next_available_tasks(spec_id)` - Find ready tasks
- `get_task_status_summary(spec_id)` - Progress overview

## Task Format Preview

Your plan will look like this:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan

## Progress Summary
- **Total Tasks:** 12
- **Completed:** 3 ✅
- **Pending:** 9 ⬜
- **Progress:** 25%

- [x] 1. Set up project structure

**CRITICAL**: Before implementing any task, you MUST:

## 1. Load Context First
**Read the specification files to understand the overall system:**
- 📖 **Read `requirements.md`** - Understand user needs and EARS acceptance criteria
- 🎨 **Read `design.md`** - Review architecture, components, and technical decisions
- ✅ **Review `tasks.md`** - See how this task fits into the overall plan

## 2. Task Implementation Process
**For each task you execute:**

### Before Implementation:
- ✅ **Context Loading** - Load and read design.md and requirements.md
- ✅ **Requirement Tracing** - Identify which user stories this task fulfills
- ✅ **Design Alignment** - Ensure implementation matches the planned architecture
- ✅ **Dependency Check** - Verify all prerequisite tasks are completed

### During Implementation:
- ✅ **Follow Design** - Implement according to the architectural decisions in design.md
- ✅ **Meet Requirements** - Ensure all relevant EARS criteria are satisfied
- ✅ **Code Quality** - Follow established patterns and conventions
- ✅ **Documentation** - Add inline comments and update relevant docs

### After Implementation:
- ✅ **Test Generation** - Create automated tests for the implemented functionality
- ✅ **Requirement Validation** - Verify EARS acceptance criteria are met
- ✅ **Integration Testing** - Ensure new code works with existing components
- ✅ **Task Completion** - Mark task as completed in tasks.md

## 3. Test Generation Requirements
**Every completed task MUST include tests:**
- **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests** - Test interactions between components
- **Acceptance Tests** - Verify EARS requirements are satisfied
- **Error Handling Tests** - Test edge cases and error conditions

## 4. Example Execution Flow
```
1. execute_task("user-auth", "2.1")
   ↓
2. Load context: Read requirements.md + design.md
   ↓
3. Identify: Task 2.1 = "Create login API endpoint"
   ↓
4. Find requirements: US-001-R01, US-001-R02 (login scenarios)
   ↓
5. Follow design: Use JWT auth from AuthService component
   ↓
6. Implement: Create login endpoint following design patterns
   ↓
7. Generate tests: Unit tests + integration tests + EARS validation
   ↓
8. Mark complete: Update task 2.1 status
```

## 🚫 What NOT to Do
- ❌ **Don't implement without reading design/requirements**
- ❌ **Don't skip test generation**
- ❌ **Don't implement tasks out of dependency order**
- ❌ **Don't ignore EARS acceptance criteria**
- ❌ **Don't bypass the planned architecture**

**Remember**: The execution phase is about building what was planned,
not making new design decisions.""",

Welcome to the interactive project specification wizard! I'll guide you
through creating a complete specification using structured, proven
workflows.

## What the Wizard Does

### 🚀 **New Project Setup**
Creates comprehensive specifications from scratch with:
- **Guided requirements** gathering using EARS notation
- **Interactive architecture** design with best practice templates
- **Automatic task generation** from requirements and design
- **Professional output** in markdown format for team collaboration

### 🔄 **Existing Project Enhancement**
Updates and expands current specifications:
- **Requirements refinement** - Add user stories and EARS criteria
- **Design evolution** - Update architecture and components
- **Task management** - Re-generate plans when requirements change
- **Progress tracking** - Checkbox-style implementation monitoring

## Three-Phase Planning Workflow

### 📝 **Phase 1: Requirements Gathering**
**Interactive prompts help you create:**
- User stories in "As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit]" format
- EARS requirements covering all 5 patterns (WHEN/IF/WHILE/WHERE/SHALL)
- Complete scenario coverage (normal, error, optional, state-driven cases)
- Quality validation ensuring testable, unambiguous requirements

**Output:** `requirements.md` with structured stories and acceptance criteria

### 🎨 **Phase 2: System Design**
**Guided architecture planning includes:**
- Architecture pattern selection (MVC, microservices, layered, etc.)
- Technology stack recommendations
- Component breakdown with responsibilities
- Data model design and relationships
- Integration and communication patterns

**Output:** `design.md` with comprehensive technical specifications

### ✅ **Phase 3: Implementation Planning**
**Automatic task generation creates:**
- Hierarchical task breakdown (1, 1.1, 1.2, etc.)
- GitHub-style checkbox format for progress tracking
- Requirement traceability (every task links to user needs)
- Dependency ordering to prevent blocking issues
- Smart auto-completion of parent tasks

**Output:** `tasks.md` with implementable task checklist

## 🚫 What the Wizard Does NOT Do

**The wizard is for PLANNING only, not execution:**
- ✅ Creates specifications and task lists
- ✅ Guides through requirements and design
- ❌ Does NOT implement tasks or write code
- ❌ Does NOT execute the implementation plan
- ❌ Does NOT scaffold applications or components

**Implementation happens AFTER wizard completion** in a separate execution
phase with proper context loading and test generation.

## How to Activate Wizard Mode

### **Via CLI (Full Interactive Experience)**
```bash
# Install and run the wizard
pipx install specforged
specforged-cli new

# With templates for common project types
specforged-cli new --template web-app
specforged-cli new --template rest-api
```

### **Via MCP (Conversational Interface)**
Just use natural language with "specforged" keywords:
- **"Use specforged to create a new project specification"**
- **"Start the specforged wizard for user authentication"**
- **"Create a spec with specforged for payment processing"**
- **"Launch specforged wizard mode for my API"**

The wizard auto-activates when no `.specifications/` folder exists.

I don't see any specifications in your project yet. Let's get you started
with the interactive wizard that will guide you through creating your first
specification.

## Start with the Wizard

The SpecForge wizard walks you through:
- **Requirements**: Define user stories with EARS acceptance criteria
- **Design**: Create system architecture and component breakdown
- **Planning**: Generate implementation tasks automatically

### Quick Start
```
wizard_start(project_name="your-app-name", description="brief description")
```

### Example
```
wizard_start(project_name="todo-app",
             description="A simple task management web application")
```

The wizard ensures you don't skip critical phases and creates a solid "
foundation for development!""",
                ),
            )
        ]

    @mcp.prompt()
    def missing_requirements_prompt() -> list[base.Message]:
        """Prompt when requirements are missing"""
        return [
            base.Message(
                role="assistant",
                content=base.TextContent(
                    type="text",
                    text="""📋 **Requirements Needed**

I notice your specification is missing requirements. Before moving to design
or implementation, you need to define what your users need.

## Add User Stories

Define who will use your system and what they want to accomplish:

```
add_requirement(
    spec_id="your-spec-id",
    as_a="user role (e.g., 'end user', 'admin')",
    i_want="what they want to do",
    so_that="why it benefits them",
    ears_requirements=["WHEN condition THE SYSTEM SHALL response"]
)
```

## EARS Requirements Help

Use these patterns for acceptance criteria:
- **WHEN** [event] **THE SYSTEM SHALL** [response]
- **WHILE** [state] **THE SYSTEM SHALL** [behavior]
- **WHERE** [feature] **THE SYSTEM SHALL** [capability]
- **THE SYSTEM SHALL** [always do this]
- **IF** [condition] **THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL** [response]

Requirements are the foundation - don't skip this step!""",
                ),
            )
        ]

    @mcp.prompt()
    def missing_design_prompt() -> list[base.Message]:
        """Prompt when design is missing"""
        return [
            base.Message(
                role="assistant",
                content=base.TextContent(
                    type="text",
                    text="""🎨 **Design Phase Required**

Great job on the requirements! Now you need to create the technical design
before generating implementation tasks.

## Create System Design

Define how your system will be built:

```
update_design(
    spec_id="your-spec-id",
    architecture="describe overall system structure",
    components="list major components and responsibilities",
    data_models="define key data structures",
    sequence_diagrams="describe key interaction flows"
)
```

## Design Elements to Include

- **Architecture pattern** (MVC, microservices, layered, etc.)
- **Major components** and their responsibilities
- **Data models** and relationships
- **Technology stack** choices
- **Integration points** between components
- **Key interaction flows**

The design phase ensures your implementation has a clear blueprint to follow!""",
                ),
            )
        ]

    @mcp.prompt()
    def incomplete_phase_prompt() -> list[base.Message]:
        """Dynamic prompt for incomplete phases"""
        return [
            base.Message(
                role="assistant",
                content=base.TextContent(
                    type="text",
                    text="""⚠️ **Phase Incomplete**

I noticed some phases of your specification need completion before proceeding.

## SpecForge Workflow

The proper sequence is:
1. **Requirements** → User stories with EARS acceptance criteria
2. **Design** → System architecture and component breakdown
3. **Planning** → Implementation task generation
4. **Execution** → Task completion with context loading

## Check Status

Use these tools to see what's missing:
- `check_initialization_status()` - Overall status and guidance
- `list_specifications()` - See all specs and their completeness
- `get_specification_details(spec_id)` - Detailed view of a specific spec

## Next Steps

Based on what's missing, use:
- `add_requirement()` for user stories
- `update_design()` for architecture
- `generate_implementation_plan()` for tasks
- `execute_task()` for implementation (after context is loaded)

Each phase builds on the previous one - don't skip steps!""",
