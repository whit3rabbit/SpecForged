# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Unified MCP Ecosystem feature transforms SpecForged from a fragile, direct-configuration approach to a robust, file-based asynchronous communication system. This architectural enhancement decouples the VS Code extension from direct MCP server control, instead using a shared "mailbox" system within the user's project workspace. The system enables bidirectional communication where the VS Code extension can initiate operations that are processed by the MCP server during its next invocation, creating a seamless user experience while maintaining architectural robustness.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using SpecForged, I want the VS Code extension to reliably communicate with the MCP server without breaking when other IDEs change their configuration formats, so that my workflow remains stable and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the VS Code extension needs to initiate an operation THEN the system SHALL write the operation to a file-based queue instead of attempting direct server communication
2. WHEN other IDEs (Cursor, Claude, Windsurf) update their configuration formats THEN the SpecForged system SHALL continue to function without requiring updates
3. WHEN the MCP server is invoked by any IDE THEN the system SHALL process all pending operations from the file-based queue before handling the user's conversational input

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform actions in the VS Code extension (like adding requirements or updating tasks) and have them automatically processed when I next interact with my conversational IDE, so that my context is always up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform a UI action in the VS Code extension THEN the system SHALL queue the operation and show it as "Pending" in the operations view
2. WHEN I switch to my conversational IDE and make a request THEN the MCP server SHALL process all queued operations before responding to my prompt
3. WHEN an operation is completed THEN the VS Code extension SHALL display a success notification and update the UI to reflect the changes
4. IF an operation fails THEN the system SHALL show an error notification with details and allow retry options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want visibility into the communication between the VS Code extension and MCP server, so that I can understand what operations are pending, completed, or failed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations are queued THEN the VS Code extension SHALL display them in an "MCP Operations" tree view
2. WHEN operations change status THEN the tree view SHALL update in real-time to show current status
3. WHEN I view the operations tree THEN the system SHALL group operations by status (Pending, In Progress, Failed, Completed)
4. WHEN conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL display them in a separate "Conflicts" section with resolution options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle conflicts gracefully when multiple operations affect the same resources, so that my specifications remain consistent and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple operations target the same specification file THEN the system SHALL detect potential conflicts
2. WHEN a conflict is detected THEN the system SHALL present resolution options to the user
3. WHEN simple conflicts occur (like duplicate operations) THEN the system SHALL resolve them automatically
4. WHEN complex conflicts require user input THEN the system SHALL provide a clear interface for manual resolution

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the operation queue system to work reliably even when the MCP server is offline, so that I can continue working in the VS Code extension without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is offline THEN the VS Code extension SHALL continue to queue operations normally
2. WHEN the MCP server comes back online THEN the system SHALL process all queued operations in chronological order
3. WHEN operations are queued while offline THEN the system SHALL persist them to disk to survive VS Code restarts
4. WHEN the server heartbeat is lost THEN the extension SHALL indicate server status in the UI

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the file-based communication to use a standardized format, so that the system is maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations are written to the queue THEN the system SHALL use a well-defined JSON schema
2. WHEN results are written back THEN the system SHALL follow a consistent result format
3. WHEN the heartbeat file is updated THEN the system SHALL include timestamp and status information
4. WHEN files are read or written THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent access safely using atomic operations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to maintain state consistency by processing extension operations before handling conversational input, so that my AI interactions have the most current context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server receives any request THEN the system SHALL check for and process pending operations first
2. WHEN operations modify specification files THEN the changes SHALL be completed before processing user prompts
3. WHEN multiple operations are queued THEN the system SHALL process them in the correct order to maintain consistency
4. WHEN an operation fails during processing THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with remaining operations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms, so that temporary failures don't disrupt my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file operations fail due to temporary issues THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN operations consistently fail THEN the system SHALL mark them as failed and notify the user
3. WHEN JSON parsing errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and preserve existing data
4. WHEN the workspace is in an invalid state THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery suggestions
